    World Wide Wind Chime Festival<br /><br />
    May 21 – July 31, 2022<br /><br />
    online exhibition<br /><br />
    ~<br /><br />
    "We have a tendency to think of Earth as a closed system. It is not. We do
    not live in a sealed spacecraft, isolated from the environment in a
    convenient bubble of air. We travel rapidly through space and time with
    our windows open, constantly exposed to the complex ecology of the galaxy
    and all it contains. We are windblown. And, while one of the consequences
    of this openness may be bouts of influenza, another could be the very
    existence of life itself."
    <span class="gray">— Lyall Watson, Heaven's Breath: A Natural History of
    the Wind (1984)</span><br /><br />
    Welcome to the world wind chime festival, a virtual exhibition in which
    artists from across the globe present their own live-streamed wind
    chimes, swaying and ringing in chorus with one another even though they
    are many thousands of miles apart.
    <br /><br />
    To learn more about each of the chimes presented here, please <a

    <br><br>
    The wind chime festival was co-organized by us — artists Ellie Hunter & Laurel Schwulst. We came together through a
    joint interest in art in the public realm, and the importance of providing opportunities for participation in the
    civic commons that aren’t always governed by institutions that require big budgets and lengthy bureaucratic processes.<br><br>
    Moreover, we
    were interested in the concept of wind as a connective tissue, and the wind chime as an object that makes us acutely
    aware of our interdependence. Is it possible for an artwork to reshape the fear and bias we have developed over the
    last two pandemic years towards the idea of being interconnected? How can we embrace co-presence, shared affect, and forces of nature that move between us and bind us in a way that is celebratory, creative, or poetic?

            "I built my wind chime from my valuable objects. The base is made of ancient iron, found on the coast of Rio de la Plata. The pendants are amulets in themselves: a key to an important place that I keep but cannot use, some shells from Mar del Plata, where I immersed myself in the sea for the first time a few months ago, among others. Given gifts and found charms, they collide with each other and their sound mixes with the hardness of the shells. But they do not touch too often, sometimes it is difficult for the wind to find the city, for it to fly freely. It is difficult for the air to arrive in its pure state. On his journey he crashes and scatters in a thousand directions, he loses his way. It fragments. You hear the city as well, and you never get used to it. Where I am from the wind finds its true voice, it is respected. But now, here where I am: I was able to find a little piece of heaven for my wind chime of luck. I ask the floating shells to be heard in their subtlety of sound. And that in its silent song the sea as immensity, brings in the wind as total."

              This extension is playful experiment to make your experience of the web more tactile. As you browse with the extension enabled, it utilizes the network traffic between your browser and servers on the web, sonifying them as they happen. Each server response gets converted into a chime sound, the bigger the response (e.g. images, video) the deeper the chime. The end result makes the web feel more material and living.
