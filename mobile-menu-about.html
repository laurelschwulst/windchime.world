    "We have a tendency to think of Earth as a closed system. It is not. We do
    not live in a sealed spacecraft, isolated from the environment in a
    convenient bubble of air. We travel rapidly through space and time with
    our windows open, constantly exposed to the complex ecology of the galaxy
    and all it contains. We are windblown. And, while one of the consequences
    of this openness may be bouts of influenza, another could be the very
    existence of life itself."<br><br>
    <span>— Lyall Watson, Heaven's Breath: A Natural History of
      the Wind (1984)</span><br /><br />

    The Wind Chime Festival is in two parts: <br /><br />

    [ part 1 — virtual ]<br><br>
    Eleven artists from across the globe were invited to create a wind chime. We sent each artist a web camera so that each chime could be live-streamed to our website. The chimes could be experienced simultaneously on the site, swaying and ringing
    in chorus with one another even though they are many thousands of miles apart. — <a href="http://virtual.windchime.world" target="_parent">more info</a> <br /><br />
    [ part 2 - irl ]<br><br>
    For the in-person festival, artists of all mediums were invited via an open call to create their own wind chime. These chimes were installed by participants in the Vale of Cashmere, Prospect Park, NYC for a one-day event on Saturday, May 21, 2022

    Who organized the wind chime festival?<br><br>
    The festival was organized by us — <a href="http://laurelschwulst.com" target="_blank">Laurel Schwulst</a> and <a href="http://elliehunter.com" target="_blank">Ellie Hunter</a>.<br><br>

    How did the wind chime festival come about?<br><br>
    We are both artists who came together through a
    joint interest in art in the public realm, and the importance of providing opportunities for participation in the
    civic commons that aren’t always governed by institutions that require big budgets and lengthy bureaucratic processes.<br><br>
    Moreover, we
    were interested in the concept of wind as a connective tissue, and the wind chime as an object that makes us acutely
    aware of our interdependence.<br><br>
    Is it possible for an artwork to reshape the fear and bias we have developed over the
    last two pandemic years towards the idea of being interconnected? How can we embrace co-presence, shared affect, and forces of nature that move between us and bind us in a way that is celebratory, creative, or poetic??

    <!-- *<br><br>
    Note that since the virtual exhibition is now over, many of the portals are no longer "live" —
    That is, originally we sent web cameras to artists around the world.
    Instead of a livestreams from web cameras, the portals will begin to be replaced with still images & maybe sound instead.
    <br><br>

    Here is a <a href="http://seashell.family/videos/www-chime-festival-archive.mp4" target="_blank">screen recording</a> of the original website (with all streams live). We also conducted a conversation with one of the artists, Mark Beasley, live from their portal on the website. Here is a <a href=" https://youtu.be/YZaDkGyAtzA" target="_blank">recording of the conversation</a>, live from the artist's backyard in San Pedro.
